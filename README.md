# full-rank-characterization
This code is concerned with the characterization of the rank of convex combinations of given full-rank matrices. 

The test is based on the solution of Linear Programming problems. After a finite number of iterations,
two outcomes are possible: (i) no convex combination is rank-deficient within the unit simplex or (ii)
convex coefficients are returned, such that the smallest singular of the convex combination of the matrices is
smaller than an arbitraty user-defined tolerance.
